Pingui is an endless runner (jumper?) platform game where you control Pingui and help him climb the mountain. Evade enemies and collect keys to unlock chests along the way.

## Getting started
- Try it on itch.io: https://jbponce.itch.io/pingui
- From Unity project: Load MainScene.

## Controls
- Arrow keys or WASD keys: Move the player.

## Specifications 

### Game Engine
Unity

### GameStates
#### StartState
Spawns starting falling tiles and waits for player to start the game. Shows the exit button on PC and Android.
#### PlayState
The main level of the game where the player can jump on the tiles to collect keys to open chests and evade enemies and obstacles.
#### RetryState
Darkens the screen and shows the retry button.

## Technical features
- Camera moves faster if the player is near the top of the screen.
- Use of interfaces for state handling.
- Rows of tiles get created when the camera reaches the top of the screen.
- Custom gravity so the player falls faster
- Movement is separated in 2 axis: Instead of using a diagonal force vector for the jump impulse, it's separated in its Y and Z components. Player jumps vertically using Y jump impulse component and moves forward or backwards linearly using Z component. When the player collides with the ground, stop all movement and correct the position.
- To check if the player can move to a certain position, overlap a sphere at the position where the player wants to move and check for collisions with obstacles.
- Jump sound pitch changes slightly and randomly everytime the player jumps for variety.
- Trees opacity turns down when the player is behind them. For this, [Alex Ocias' dither transparency shader](https://ocias.com/blog/unity-stipple-transparency-shader/) was used. Simply making the material transparent wouldn't work because trees will render incorrectly.
